# Hi there, I'm M Srinivas Reddy 👋 

### self Introduction
Good morning, my name is Srinivas Reddy. I recently completed my graduation from Rao Bahadur College, Ballari, with a strong interest in AWS cloud and networking. My final year project was a School Database Management System, and during my AWS internship I gained practical exposure to cloud services, after which I developed and deployed an AWS Exam Portal as my personal project. I have also completed the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and I am eager to contribute my skills and grow professionally,
